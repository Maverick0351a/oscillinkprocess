# Oscillink Process™ v2

Vendor- and domain-agnostic reference scaffold for autonomous AI development:

Plan → Scaffold → Build → Test → Benchmark → Publish → Maintain

- Repo: Local code to be pushed from your machine
- Docs: See `oscillink_process_v2/oscillink_process_v2/README.md` for details

Once you push the local project, CI will run tests on each PR.
