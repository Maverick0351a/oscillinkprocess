# Oscillink Process™ — Overview (v2)

**Eight concrete phases:** **Idea → Plan → Scaffold → Build → Test → Benchmark → Publish → Maintain**.

- **Idea:** Capture a goal or problem statement.
- **Plan:** Generate a structured approach or roadmap.
- **Scaffold:** Produce a skeleton (files, components, configuration).
- **Build:** Complete the scaffold into a running artifact.
- **Test:** Execute in a controlled environment to produce results.
- **Benchmark:** Compare results to acceptance thresholds.
- **Publish:** Release or deploy the approved artifact.
- **Maintain:** Monitor and iteratively improve post-release.

This method is **domain-agnostic** and **dependency-agnostic**.
