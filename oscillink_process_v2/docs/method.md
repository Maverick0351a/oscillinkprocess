# Method (Formalized Steps)

1. **Idea Intake**: receive an objective or concept with constraints.
2. **Planning**: produce a structured plan specifying components and steps.
3. **Scaffolding**: synthesize a minimal project structure or artifact skeleton.
4. **Building**: implement and assemble components into an executable artifact.
5. **Testing**: run the artifact in a controlled environment to obtain results.
6. **Benchmarking**: evaluate results against declared acceptance thresholds.
7. **Publishing**: release or deploy artifacts that satisfy the thresholds.
8. **Maintaining**: perform post-release checks and updates over time.

These steps can iterate until benchmarks are satisfied.
