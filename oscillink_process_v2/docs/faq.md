# FAQ

**Is this bound to a specific AI model?**  
No. It is a process definition that can be implemented with any intelligent or rule-based agent.

**Does this repository include proprietary logic?**  
No. It demonstrates the process only. Advanced agent logic or domain packs belong in separate, licensed modules.

**Why no provenance?**  
To keep the phases concrete and avoid abstract concepts. Maintenance captures operational follow-through without requiring a special record-keeping construct.
