# Patent Information

**Patent Pending — U.S. Provisional Application No. 63/900,694**  
**Receipt Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Title:** Systems and Methods for Autonomous Idea → Plan → Scaffold → Build → Test → Benchmark → Publish → Maintain  
**First Named Inventor:** Travis Jacob Johnson

**Abstract (dependency-agnostic):**  
Systems and methods for autonomous product generation wherein intelligent agents receive an idea, generate a plan, synthesize a scaffold, complete the scaffold into a functional artifact, test the artifact in a controlled environment, benchmark results against declared acceptance thresholds, and publish the artifact upon satisfaction of the thresholds, followed by maintenance activities. The method is domain-agnostic and supports software, simulations, data/ML pipelines, control systems, and experimental workflows.
