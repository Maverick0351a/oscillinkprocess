# Lifecycle Details

- **Idea:** input formats may include natural language, structured specs, or programmatic objectives.
- **Plan:** outputs a roadmap listing components, milestones, and acceptance criteria.
- **Scaffold:** creates directories, files, or schemas needed to implement the plan.
- **Build:** writes or assembles code/components to satisfy scaffold requirements.
- **Test:** executes deterministic checks with bounded resources.
- **Benchmark:** evaluates metrics against thresholds (e.g., accuracy, latency, resource limits).
- **Publish:** promotes artifacts to a release destination (e.g., repository directory).
- **Maintain:** periodically re-test, update, and record maintenance actions.

The emphasis is on **concrete, auditable actions** rather than abstract record-keeping.
